Hi, I'm Paul, a **software engineer** at [@InvestorHub](https://github.com/FreshXYZ). Previously, I was at [@Xplor](https://github.com/xplor) and [@99designs](https://github.com/99designs), where I built and scaled customer-facing products and contributed to internal tooling improvements.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about the latest developments in tech and like to unwind with reading and exercise. 

I also have two dogs which will forever be puppies in my eyes.
